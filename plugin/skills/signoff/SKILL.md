name: signoff
description: Ask the user to sign off on a batch of decisions on a local web page, with mockups or screenshots, orange highlight boxes, costs, single or multiple choice options with your recommendation preselected, Other and Skip choices, a comment per item and a free-text box. Several rounds show as tabs on one page, earlier ones read only. Use when you have 4 or more decisions to put to the user at once, or any decision that needs an image or a cost to judge. For 1 to 3 quick questions without images, use AskUserQuestion instead.

# Signoff

Signoff turns JSON files of decisions into a page on `127.0.0.1`, one tab per round. The user answers in the
browser; every change is saved to an answers file beside each decisions file. When the user presses **Done**,
Signoff exits and prints the answers files' absolute paths. You run it in the background, so the exit wakes
you. Rounds answered earlier stay on the page as read-only tabs, so the user can look back at them.

## When to use it

- **Signoff:** 4 or more decisions at once, or any decision where the user should see a mockup or a
  screenshot, or weigh a cost.
- **AskUserQuestion:** 1 to 3 questions with short options and no images.
- Nothing at all when the answer is obvious: do the obvious step and say so.

## 1. Write the round

Keep one folder per topic, `<decisions folder>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`, with the date the topic started and a short
English slug. The decisions folder is `${user_config.folder}`, from the plugin's settings; when that is empty or not
a path, it is `.signoff`. It is relative to the project root unless it is an absolute path.

Each round of questions is one file in that folder: `round-01.json`, `round-02.json` and so on. Put every image
in the same folder or below it, shared by all rounds (for example `mockups/`). Use English file names. Images
must be PNG, JPEG, WebP or GIF; render an SVG or an HTML mockup to PNG first.

How to batch:

- Put independent rounds in the same run: they open as tabs side by side. At most 3 open tabs per run, and
  about 12 items per tab; split anything larger.
- A round that depends on the answers to another is a new run, after the first one has finished, on the same
  folder with the next number. The finished rounds then show read only.
- Never edit a round that is done (its answers file says `done: true`); ask again in a new round.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "title": "What goes into the settings redesign?",
  "tab": "Layout",
  "intro": "My recommendation is preselected on each item.",
  "notice": "Synthetic data only",
  "lang": "en",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "settings-layout",
      "group": "Layout",
      "title": "Settings in two columns",
      "description": "The settings page is one long column today.",
      "cost": "About 60 lines of CSS.",
      "images": [
        {"src": "mockups/settings.png", "caption": "Proposed", "boxes": [[20, 10, 40, 50]]}
      ],
      "select": "one",
      "options": [
        {"id": "two", "label": "Two columns"},
        {"id": "one", "label": "Keep one column", "detail": "no work"}
      ],
      "recommended": "two",
      "comment": true,
      "other": false,
      "skippable": false
    }
  ],
  "free_text": {"title": "Anything else", "placeholder": "Anything the list does not ask about"}
}
```

- `tab`: a short label for the round's tab, one or two words. Default: the `title`.
- `id` (item and option): letters, digits, `-`, `_`, `.`; unique and stable. The answers are keyed by them.
- `select`: `"one"` (radio buttons, at least two options) or `"many"` (checkboxes). Default `"one"`.
- `recommended`: an option id for `"one"`, a list of option ids for `"many"`. It is preselected and labelled
  "Recommended". Always give one when you have a view, and say why in `description` or `cost`.
- `boxes`: `[x, y, w, h]` in percent of the image (0 to 100), measured from the top left. Each box is drawn
  in orange and the rest of the image is dimmed. Several boxes per image are fine. From pixels:
  x = left ÷ image width × 100, y = top ÷ image height × 100, w = box width ÷ image width × 100,
  h = box height ÷ image height × 100.
- **One picture per option** whenever the options look different: put one image per option in `images`, in
  option order, each with `caption` set to the option's `label`. Two or more visual options get one picture
  each, never a single picture for all.
- `other: true` adds an **Other** choice with a text field; `skippable: true` adds **Skip**. Offer Other when
  your options may not cover what the user wants, and Skip when not answering is a valid answer.
- **A picture or a board.** Use a picture (`src`, a PNG) for a screen as it is or as it will look. Use a board
  (`{"html": "boards/x.html", "caption": "…"}` in `images`) when the user should try it: resize it, switch light
  and dark, click a toggle. A board is one self-contained HTML file inside the folder, up to 2 MiB: inline CSS
  and JS, images as `data:` URLs (it runs sandboxed and cannot load anything). Put nothing secret in it: a
  script in a board could still send data out over WebRTC. The page passes the
  theme as `?theme=light` or `?theme=dark`; read it with
  `new URLSearchParams(location.search).get("theme")`. The user can view it 1280, 768 or 390 pixels wide, so
  make it responsive. Boards take no `boxes`; highlight inside the HTML.
- `marks: true` lets the user draw rectangles on the item's pictures, each with a comment. Turn it on when
  "point at what you mean" is a likely answer, for example on a screenshot with several problems.
- `group`: a heading appears whenever it changes from the item before.
- `lang`: the language of your text, for example `"en"` or `"hu"`. The page's own labels follow it (English
  and Hungarian are built in; anything else gets English).
- `notice`: optional, a short banner under the header. Use it to say what the user must know before
  answering, for example that the mockups hold synthetic data only.
- `comment`: a comment box under the options; default `true`.
- All text is plain text. Line breaks are kept; HTML and Markdown are shown as typed.
- The full format is in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/signoff/schema.json`.

## 2. Run it in the background

Run this from the main session, with the Bash tool and `run_in_background: true`:

```
python3 -I "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/signoff/signoff.py" "<folder>"
```

It serves every `round-NN.json` in the folder. On Windows run
`py -3 -I "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/signoff/signoff.py" "<folder>"`, never the bare `signoff` command: from the Bash
tool that reaches the macOS and Linux launcher, which calls `python3`. On macOS and Linux, `signoff "<folder>"`
runs the same program where the plugin's `bin/` is on the PATH. Signoff opens the browser
itself, with a link that works once. Add `--no-open` when there is no browser on this machine (an SSH
session); the link is on stderr then, and the user forwards the same port number.

A background command started by a subagent ends when that subagent ends, so the page would die with it. A
subagent may write the round files and hand back; the main session runs Signoff.

If any round is invalid, Signoff exits at once with code 1 and says on stderr which file, which item and which
field is wrong. Fix the file and run it again. It also exits 1 when every round in the folder is done already.

In a repository other people share, when the decisions folder is inside it, check whether the folder would be
committed: `git check-ignore -q "<folder>"`. Exit 1 means it is not ignored: tell the user and suggest the line
`<decisions folder>/` for the project's `.gitignore`; do not add it yourself. Any other non-zero exit: skip this.

Then tell the user, in one or two lines, that the page is open and what it asks. Do not wait in a loop and do
not poll the answers file: keep working on what does not depend on the answers, or end your turn. You are
woken when Signoff exits.

## 3. Read the answers

stdout holds one answers file path per line, one for each round that was open in this run, in tab order, such
as `<folder>/round-02.answers.json`. Read every line, not only the last:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "done": true,
  "saved": "2026-01-01T12:34:58Z",
  "answers": {
    "settings-layout": {"choice": "one", "comment": "not now", "source": "user"},
    "filters": {"choice": ["date", "_other"], "other": "Colour", "comment": "", "source": "user"},
    "sidebar": {"choice": "_skip", "comment": "", "source": "user"}
  },
  "free_text": ""
}
```

- Exit code 0: the user pressed Done; `done` is `true` in every file listed.
- With several rounds open, the user accepts each one before Done (the page has a Summary tab). You are still
  woken only once, at Done. Each answers file then has `accepted: true` and `accepted_at`;
  `changed_after_accept: true` only shows up in a file you read before Done, after a timeout.
- Exit code 1 after the page was open: the start link was used twice, and Signoff stopped because something
  else may have opened the page. Tell the user; running the same command again resumes with a new link. If
  an answers file already says `done: true`, the other visitor pressed Done: do not act on it; ask the user to
  check it and move it away first (give them the command), or the next run stops with "already done".
- Exit code 2: the page sat idle for the timeout (120 minutes; change it with `--timeout <minutes>`, `0`
  means never). stdout lists the rounds the user changed, with the answers so far saved as `done: false`;
  untouched items show your recommendation, which the user has not confirmed. If stdout is empty, nothing was
  answered. Either way, ask the user whether to reopen it; running the same command again
  resumes from the saved answers.
- `choice` is an option id, `null` when nothing is picked (`"one"`), or a list (`"many"`). `_other` means the
  user picked Other and wrote `other`; `_skip` means the user skipped the item. Read an `other` text as the
  user's own answer.
- `source`: `user` when the user changed the item's options; `accept_all` when the user pressed **Accept all
  recommendations** and left the item; `recommended` when the preselected recommendation was never touched.
  Treat `accept_all` as accepted, and `recommended` after Done as accepted without a second look.
- `marks` (only on items with `marks: true`): `[{"image": 0, "box": [x, y, w, h], "comment": "…"}]`, where
  `image` is the picture's position in the item's `images` from 0 and `box` is in percent like `boxes`. Each one
  is the user pointing at something; act on its comment as you would on the item's comment.
- `<folder>/round-NN.answers.md` holds the same answers as Markdown for people. Read the JSON, not the
  Markdown.
- Compare each choice with your `recommended`: where they differ, the user overruled you. Read every comment
  and the free text; they often change the scope more than the choices do.

## 4. Turn the answers into actions

- Summarise the outcome back to the user in a few lines: what is decided, where they overruled you, and
  anything in the comments you need to clarify.
- Do the work each choice implies, or add it to the project's task list or tracker.
- Move every durable decision into the project's own decision log (an ADR, a decisions file, the commit
  message), in your own words. Do not commit the raw answers files: Signoff writes a `.gitignore` with
  `*.answers.json` and `*.answers.md` into the folder when the folder has none, and never overwrites an
  existing one.
- Then record the outcome beside the round, as `<round>.outcome.json` (for example `round-02.outcome.json`):
  `{"log": "<path of the decision log>", "line": "<the line you wrote there>", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}`. The
  past-decisions page shows that line with the round. Write it only after the decision is in the log.

## Past decisions

When the user wants to look back at earlier rounds, or asks what was decided before, run this in the
background and tell the user the page is open:

```
python3 -I "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/signoff/signoff.py" --history "<project root>" --folder "<decisions folder>"
```

It lists every round in the decisions folder, read only, with outcomes and warnings.
Add `--since YYYY-MM-DD` for a long history. It writes nothing and has no Done: the user closes it with Ctrl+C,
or it stops after the idle timeout, and stdout stays empty. To answer the question yourself, read the answers
and outcome files directly instead.

## Rules

- **Never delete anything**, including old decision folders and answers files. If something should go,
  tell the user and give them the exact command to run.
- **Sensitive data stays local.** The page and the answers never leave the machine. Do not copy a decisions
  file, its images or its answers into a cloud service, an issue, a pull request or a chat that leaves the
  machine. Screenshots of real systems may show secrets or personal data: crop them or use a mockup.
- One topic per folder, one round per file. Follow-up questions go in the next `round-NN.json` of the same
  folder, never into a finished round.
- Keep the recommendation honest: preselecting it makes it easy to accept, so put the downside in `cost`.
